# Electrocam - April Fools

> Please note, [the development of the real Electrocam has been posponed indefinitely](https://newsroom.peroxaan.com/update/2021/03/06/update-on-electrocam.html).

This is the source code of the camera app we showed in the [Introducing ~~Putin~~ Wide Mode in Electrocam](https://twitter.com/Peroxaan/status/1377615283121225739) video we published on April 1st, 2021. The UI has been slightly edited though, and it was been renamed to "Wide Mode" instead.

It **can not** take pictures or video. It's only the UI, and it has only been tested on Android (you can create the iOS project by running `flutter create .`).

Enjoy!
